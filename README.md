# GradCAM Visualization

## Overview
This code demonstrates how to use GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize the areas of an image that are most important for predicting a specific class. It uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to generate a heatmap overlay on the original image, highlighting the regions that contribute most to the prediction.

## Steps

1. Imports: Import necessary libraries including PyTorch, torchvision, PIL (Pillow), NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.

2. Preprocessing Transformations: Define a series of preprocessing transformations (Resize, ToTensor, Normalize) to be applied to the input image. This prepares the image for input into the neural network.

3. GradCAM Class: Define a GradCAM class that takes a pre-trained model and a target layer as input. This class implements the logic for computing the GradCAM heatmap.
    - Initialization: Initialize the GradCAM class with the model and target layer. Set feature_maps and gradient attributes to None and set the model to evaluation mode.
    - save_feature_maps: Define a method to save the feature maps of the target layer.
    - save_gradient: Define a method to save the gradient of the target layer.
    - forward: Define a method to perform a forward pass through the model.
    - backward: Define a method to compute the gradient of the target class with respect to the feature maps.
    - generate: Define a method to generate the GradCAM heatmap by combining the gradient and feature maps.

4. Load Pre-trained Model: Load a pre-trained ResNet-50 model using torch.hub.load.

5. Prepare the Image: Load and preprocess the input image (tench.jpeg) using the defined transformations.

6. Compute GradCAM Heatmap: Create an instance of the GradCAM class with the loaded model and target layer. Generate the GradCAM heatmap for the target class (281, which corresponds to 'tabby cat').

7. Visualize the Heatmap: Convert the heatmap tensor to a NumPy array and resize it to match the size of the input image. Apply a color map (COLORMAP_JET) to the heatmap and overlay it on the original image. Display the superimposed image using Matplotlib.
